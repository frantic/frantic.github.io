Good reasons to choose JavaScript

In my recent post, [JavaScript Gob Jabbar](/javascript-gom-jabbar/), talked about how everything about JavaScript ecosystem is a source of constant pain and suffering.

However, after 15 years of using JS I'm still choosing it for my projects. Can this be [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)? Check out my arguments and decide for yourself.

I believe JavaScript stack has so many great things that it's worth choosing in 2023. Things that other languages and ecosystems lack.

I'm focusing on building "consumer products". Websites, SaaS, apps, etc.

By JavaScript I mean "JavaScript ecosystem": ECMAScript standard, different implementations, tools, libraries, etc.

## Web is JavaScript

If you are building for web, sooner or later, no matter if you want it or not, you'll have to deal with javascript.

HTMX, TwinSpark and the like
LiveView
ClojureScript

While similar solutions worked for native CPU architectures, same can't be said for web. There's always

WASM is X years old and the amount of progress for "replacing" JS is neligible. It's clear it's gonna be a niche

But at the end of the day you'll have to deal with JavaScript no matter what

## Single language for frontend and backend

Other languages have tried
Edge
Even for big teams it's an advantage

## JavaScript is a decent language

OK maybe it goes against the popular internet meme that JavaScript is weird and illogical. Every language has its quircks, and take out of context they do look dumb. JS has active and functioning standards body that the whole community rallied around.

Functional
Can be object-oriented. Prototypical inheritance
Monkey-patching. You can replace
Hackable. For example you can replace a lot. It's not needed often, but this ability is very powerful.
JSON

## TypeScript is very good

Structural Type System. Go Interfaces

Since both my frontend and backend use TypeScript, this means I can share types between the two. When I remove a colum on the database

I can run my TypeScript project even if it's full of type errors.

## React

## There's package for everything

Most important of all. If you like your language and tools, and if you are productive with them, don't let the internet change your mind.
