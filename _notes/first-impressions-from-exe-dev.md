```js

Let's add some usability niceities:
- Cmd+O should create new note (both from index or note view)
- Cmd+V of a URL, when some text is focused, should create a markdown link to that URL and focused text as link text
- Cmd+S should trigger save
- When pressing Enter inside a markdown list it should prefix next line with corresponding list marker (numbered lists too)
- **Cmd+B makes text markdown bold**
- When pressing enter on line that starts with codefences (```) insert corresponding closing code fences on the new line after the cursor
- Cmd+Opt+Up/Down should move the current line up/down
- _Cmd+I makes text markdown italic_
- and the rest of cool features 

**Do not** all this in HTML-native way for text inputs, there's an event posted that I forgot what it's called that ideally fits this use cases and supports Cmd+Z.
