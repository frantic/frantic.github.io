Finally getting started with Jekyll. 2016 New Year's resolution -- write regularly. Of course, due to procrastination and perfectionism I haven't started till March.

As you can tell from aesthetics here, I'm fascinated by minimalism. All pages are designed to not have any external dependencies, all it takes is a single HTTP request. There is no <strike>images</strike>, fonts, social buttons, comments, tags, categories. No distractions.

The date I believe is important though. I'm going to write about technology and software development, and in this area things get outdated very quickly. To save myself from the embarrassment, and help the reader asses the relevance of a piece of text, the publishing date is pretty handy.
