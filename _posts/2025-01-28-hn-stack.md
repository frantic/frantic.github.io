If you want to build a web app The Hacker News Way, here's the stack you should use:

- **Rust** -- the only language that gives you the priviledge of calling your app _"blazing fast"_. According to the undocumented Hacker News rules, any post mentioning Rust in the title starts with 10 points.
- **Postgres** -- the most beloved database that can do absolutely everything: manage data, handle row-level authorization, run job queues, replace Redis, vacuum your apartment (or its own tablesâ€¦ who cares?). No ORMs allowed.
- **HTMX** -- because JavaScript is obviously the worst part about web development. Bonus points: you get to call yourself the [CEO of HTMX](https://htmx.org/essays/lore/#htmx-ceo), very helpful in this turbulent job market.
- **Hetzner** -- for just $4.59/mo you can get a server that can easily handle HN's famous [hug-of-death](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147951).

Make sure you build your app while WFH, commuting to the office was invented by evil corporations.

If this post made your simle, maybe you should cut down on reading Hacker News. I know I should.
