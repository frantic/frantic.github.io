For posterity. This is a long post full of nostalgia. Unless you are one of my lovely children, I'm not sure you'll find any value in this text.

So I could make folders. But how do you make files? I've seen these around but I didn't know how to create one. And I asked my older cousin about this (they had computer class) and she gave me a book that had something about it. It was called Turbo Pascal.

That night I read about how to create a file. But there was a lot more to it. A programming language. You could write some text and it would make a computer do stuff. I was absulutely enchanted.

That's when I discovered I was the weird one. My peers would use this time to play games. I continued to explore Norton Commander.

I built computers of everything. Clay, LEGOs, cardboards. I draw keyboard layouts to learn how to type. I collected every screenshot of a program I could find in some random magazines and tried to re-draw them.

The first thing I ever programmed was a watch with built in scheduler. It worked fine until I plugged a vacuum cleaner to one of its outlets and made it make smoke. I still had a lot to learn.

I did play games though. Half Life was absolutely mind blowing, I completed it more than a dozen times with all mods I could get my hands on. I hated Counter Strike though because you had to wait for the bots to finish the round.

Cossaks was also super cool, especially after I discovered the map builder. Star Craft. All my friends wanted to play the mighty Terrans or high-tech Protoss, but all I wanted was to prove them wrong and picked Zerg.

Visual Basic. I remember my family going to my cousin's birthday, but I was so excited about the achievment that I decided to skip the promise of cake and continue working on my magnificent calculator.

I wanted to be a programmer, that much was clear. For this, there wasn't that many universities around. 2 or 3 were most famous for the emerging Software, but most of the education was still focused around hardware.

I remember walking the campus street at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. It was just after the classes, swarmed with students. Weird, geeky. Hard to explain but I felt like these were "my people". I wanted to be among them.

I applied and did pretty well on exams. Unfortunatelly to join the highest ranked faculty I was lacking 1 point. So I had to pick from one of the less prestigious options. I'm so glad I did.

That summer I found a photo in a newspaper that had an english word "freelancer" on it. I didn't know the word so I looked it up on the internet and found this to be a whole industry of tech contracting (the newspaper had a different context for it). I registered on a few freelance markeplaces and started bidding on projects that listed Delphi.

One of these days I was bored and randomly stumbled on the weirdest thing I've seen in a while. It was called "\_why's guide to Ruby". I was hooked. `5.times { print "Odelay!" }`.

It was then I realized I was stagnating. Very comfortable in a job that paid very well, but in tech space that was utterly boring and lacked all innovation.

I dreamed of becoming a digital nomad for some time. Travel across Ukraine in trains with my MacBook Air. I still regret not doing it.

But there was a good reason. By some chance I found an event on social network. Facebook was coming to Kyiv to do a tech talk and host a hackathon. Hackathons were popular back then and that same year earlier I've participated in one. We made a Google Docs plugin Clippy.

Facebook's presentation was one of these moments where I felt a spark going off in my brain. Small teams, shipping products end-to-end, without the corporate process and the swarm of PMs and QAs trying to abstract you away from the customer. "Facebook culture" was a thing and it resonated with me. I applied to their engineering positions and got a rejection letter right away.

I did participate in Facebook's hackathon held in one of the most expensive hotels in the center of Kyiv. It was a lot of fun. We built a walkie-talkie app for iOS. We didn't win any prizes though. But the recruiter reached out and offered an interview. I was consfused a bit since I already had a rejection from them, but later I learned these were totally different pipelines.

Going into the interviews, my goal was to learn how Facebook does it. The possibility of getting an offer was not even something I thought about. My only goal was to see how far I can go.

All the interviews were remote, over Skype calls (no video). I was late to one of the interviews because I miscalculated the time difference between US West and Ukraine. I joined all interviews from my dorm room, with 3 more people who I lived with that tried to keep quiet but were pretty noisy.

I found interview challenges fun and interesting. Write a simple regex, check if a string is a palindrome. I solved them all in Ruby and tried to make the solution look eloquent. I didn't

Facebook campus was like a Disnayland for me.
