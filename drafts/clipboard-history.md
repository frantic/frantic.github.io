# clipboard history

This is one of my secret productivity tools I use every day. I can't even imagine having 

Having only one single thing in the clipboard is very limiting.

Alfred overall is an amazing piece of software that became umreplaceable for me, but its clipboard manager is what I really like

I configured it to Cmd+Ctrl+V sortcut. Then I can copy something, and then copy something else. Pressing the shortcut shows the history of copied items, I can search that list too.

Alfred 3 has added support for images as well. It's amazing for building test plans, I can just copy a bunch of things and then paste them in batch.

## use cases 

I can just spam copy everything, and then I can paste things in the order I want

Snippets is a nice extension of this system. I have a set of pre-defined snippets I use. There's a group I use for code reviews that contains my common reviwers' names and also links I often use durint the code review.

Another group has a bunch of Unicode symbols for things like arrows and macOS keyboard combinations. I never bothered to remember the unicide sequence code for these

I often just copy the content of the file I'm editing (Cmd+A, Cmd+C) as a "pure man's backup solution.

And if you are using password manager and rely on the clipboard to paste your password, don't worry, Alfred has a blacklist of apps which it will ignore.

I'm surprised very few people use it.
