      <summary>Follow the rules, break the rules, transcend the rules</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>I’ve been trying to write a blog post about following “best practices” and how eventually you end up breaking them. But I couldn’t find the right words until I randomly stumbled upon a concept from Japanese martial art: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">Shuhari</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is known that, when we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of shu, ha, and ri. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these forms with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this explains everything I see in the software development industry.</p>
<p>First, we follow the rules. Learn best practices. Read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang of Four</a>. “Keep it simple, stupid”, “Do not repeat yourself”. <em>shu</em>.</p>
<p>Then, we rebel and break the rules. NoSQL, React, Rails and many others were the expression of breaking the established best practices. <em>ha</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, we transcend the rules. There are no rules and no breaking the rules. You just do. <em>ri</em>.</p>
<p>A beginner following tech Twitter or Hacker News nowadays will be very confused. Some people preach best practices, others are loudly recommend breaking them. <small>(Unfortunately you rarely see anything from those who transcend them.)</small></p>
<p>People who grew up writing simple HTML and JS see React as breaking the rules. People who grew up writing React see <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> as breaking the rules. And this process will never end.</p>
<p>We need to realize is that everyone is on a different stage of this process. It doesn’t help the beginner to be thrown into “ha”: it will only confuse them.</p>
<p>So should you follow the best practices of clean code? Well, yes and no: <a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/">“Let clean code guide you. Then let it go.”</a></p>

      <summary>Questioning the status quo of software maintenance</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>Few weeks ago my microwave stopped working. I called several repair shops and they all told me the same thing: “just buy a new one, it’s cheaper than what we’ll charge for fixing it”.</p>
<p>Maintaining software projects costs a lot of money. Thousands of books have been written on “clean code” and “best practices”, all focused on driving the maintanance costs down. Every company or team I worked on has a similar story: “we built this prototype in just a few weeks, but now it’s a mess and we can’t add new features”. Building something new is fun, maintaining old legacy systems is not fun.</p>
<p>To add to the problem, businesses don’t understand the maintanance costs. After you ship a feature, the business considers it “done”. If you want to address tech debt, systematic bugs, refactorings, library upgrades, etc. it takes a lot of explanations and convincing. And even if you manage to get the budget, it’s not a priority. The business likes to ship new features, not maintain the old ones.</p>
<p>But what if there was a magic tool. A tool that could build an app for your from scratch every time something about buisness domain changes. And it will use the latest libraries, latest best practices, hottest programming language. And it will be fast (minutes) and cheap (few dollars worth of GPU time).</p>
<p>What would the world look like if we got rid of software maintanance costs?</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Oh, about the microwave. I bought a new one, same brand and same model name. The new microwave sucks: the build quality is low, it’s loud. I want my old microwave back.</p>

        <p>A senior engineer joins a team. Before long, they start noticing weird quirks in the codebase: two ID fields on the same DB table, one-off Redis cluster outside the company’s AWS, React components organized in a very unorthodox way.</p>
<p>So they turn around to the teammate who has been on the team since the beginning and ask: <em>“why is it built this way?”</em></p>
<p>But “why” is a terrible question for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It makes people defensive. Subconsciously, the engineers who built the system might feel threatened. They’ll start making up arguments to justify the system’s current shape. “Well, Redis on XXX provider is actually superior because …”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t help you decide what to do with the system. Is it still the best solution or should you do something about it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a better question: <em>“what were you trying to achieve?”</em></p>
<p>It focuses on the intent, not the means of getting there. Maybe the team was trying to scale this experiment really quickly or tried to align itself with other teams in the organization. You’ll see the current solution in its context.</p>
<p>Then you can easily compare the original intention and the current company goals. Maybe some of these things are not relevant anymore, and instead of lengthy migration of the Redis cluster, the right thing to do is to remove it altogether. Or ignore it, and focus on the things your users really care about.</p>

      <title>Replacing Jekyll for my blog</title>
      <updated>2022-08-08T12:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <summary>How I replaced Jekyll with 200 lines of JavaScript</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>I <a href="https://frantic.im/hello-world">started this blog</a> in 2016. At the time, “static blogging” was becoming very popular and getting started was easy. I simply used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with GitHub pages.</p>
<p>But then I got a new laptop and the simplicity turned into a nighmare. A new Ruby version, an incompatible Jekyll gem version, cryptic C++ compilation errors of one of Jekyll’s dependencies. I’ve tried RVM, I’ve tried Bundler, I’ve tried Docker.</p>
<p>At this point, blogging felt more like fighting with the tools.</p>
<p>After I upgraded to M1 Mac, the setup broke again and I decided to take a different path.</p>
<p>I looked for Jekyll alternatives but didn’t find anything that I liked. Here’s what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to install, indeally a single binary (supporting ARM &amp; x86)</li>
<li>Compatible with my Jekyll templates</li>
<li>Hackable, without the need to install compiler toolchain</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometime in 2021 I re-implemented parts of Jekyll I cared about in JavaScript in ~200 lines of code. It only needs NodeJS, all the dependencies are vendored-in (so there’s no package.json, yarn, npm, pnpn or whatever). It only uses JS syntax that’s been stable for years, so there’s no TypeScript or Babel needed.</p>
<p>I got to keep all the custom Jekyll theme files. Even the fancy <code>related.html</code> template that renders “Related posts” section at the bottom works without changes!</p>
<p>On top of that, I added a few features that make it easier for me to write. I start by typing <code>blog</code> in my terminal, and I see this:</p>
<pre><code>$ blog
...
Building pages/subscribe.md
Building pages/talks.html
Listening on http://localhost:9099/

Things you can do:
  n [title] - Create a new file in _posts
  p         - Commit &amp; push to GitHub
  e         - Edit in VSCode
  w         - Open in browser
</code></pre>
<p>This little menu let’s me take the most common actions right from the console. For example, the first command converts “Fancy Blog Title” into “2022-08-08-fancy-blog-title.md”, creates this file in the right place from the template and opens it in the editor.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much these little inconveniences prevented me from writing!</p>
<p>However, I can’t say I’m completely happy with the static blog setup. Here’s a few areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier to insert images. Currently I have to put the png in the right place and manually link it from the blog’s content. When image is not found I get no errors. There’s no way to cleanup unused images. I wish I could just Cmd+V an image from the clipboard or use a tag that fetches it directly from Figma.</li>
<li>Automatically generate OG image. The social previews are very important for attracting attention and branding. I want my blog engine to generate these based on post’s title during the build phase.</li>
<li>Validate links. Currently the blog can be full of invalid links and I don’t even know it. At the build time, it should make sure that at least local links are working.</li>
<li>Private sections &amp; posts. I have plenty of topics I would like to share only with a limited set of subscribers. I want to wrap parts of the posts in <code>&lt;private&gt;</code> tag and have it hidden from the public internet. This also includes “preview” posts I can share with some friends</li>
<li>Grammarly &amp; Hemingway App integration. When the post is ready, I want a simple, automated way to send it to an AI that can help me fix typos and adjust my writing style.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, I’m not planning to turn this into a standalone product. I like that it’s just a part of this blog and I can keep it very simple and very specific to my needs.</p>

      <title>On Leaving Facebook</title>
      <updated>2022-01-21T12:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <link rel="alternate" href="https://frantic.im/leaving-facebook" />
      <summary>After 8.5 years at Facebook I joined a small startup called Replit. Leaving wasn't easy, and during the process I've talked to half a dozen friends who were in the similar situation.</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>I left Facebook (Meta) in 2021 to join a small startup called Replit. Leaving wasn’t easy, and during the process I’ve talked to half a dozen friends who were in the similar situation. I hope this post would be useful to senior engineers who are looking to leave.</p>
<p>Disclaimers:</p>
<ul>
<li>This post isn’t sponsored by Replit, Facebook (Meta), or any other company or product mentioned here.</li>
<li>The advice might not work for you in you are in a different spot in your career.</li>
</ul>
<h3>History so far</h3>
<p>I joined Facebook in October 2012. I felt very lucky to be there. It’s hard to describe the energy and culture that existed at the time.</p>
<p>I worked on all sorts of things. Started from internal tooling for tasks and configuration, then joined a new team that was bringing ReactJS to mobile (later known as React Native).</p>
<p>After that I worked on making an awesome onboarding experience for VR users at Oculus, and ended up learning a ton about cryptography and security protocols. Then I moved to Seattle, co-founded a team that made the Messenger for macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>8.5 years is forever in the tech world. Facebook makes it very easy to switch between teams, and every project I’ve been on felt like a small startup inside a large company.</p>
<h3>Reasons to quit</h3>
<p>Facebook has changed a lot since 2012. The types of projects that I thrive in were harder to come by.</p>
<p>The magic was gone.</p>
<p>Things I care a lot about, like quality, craft and focus, weren’t as important as scale, metrics and PSC.</p>
<p>None of this happened suddenly, just a very slow process. That was one of the reason it was hard to leave.</p>
<h3>Why is it so hard to quit Facebook</h3>
<p>Working at Facebook is very comfortable. There’s a million benefits, but some of them are harder to notice.</p>
<p>The salary is high. Facebook aims to pay top 5% compensation in the market (we’ll get back to that). This makes a lot of other things very comfortable: you can go to a restaurant without worrying too much about the bill, get a nicer car, a nicer house, better stuff.</p>
<p>The stock is doing well and is very liquid. Refreshers are constantly added in a way where there’s no great time to leave, there’s always a next vesting event to look forward to.</p>
<p>The benefits are top notch. Almost every doctor I visited said “wow” when looking at the health insurance. It’s very comfortable to know that you are likely not going to receive a huge bill for doing an ultra sound for a routine checkup.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Prestige. Facebook gets a lot of blame in media lately, but in everyday life it’s still very prestigious place to be working at. Getting a mortgage or a car loan is easy, saying you work for Facebook gets you on the fast line.</p>
<p>It’s comfortable to know that even if your project fails, you are not going to loose your job, your savings or your RSUs.</p>
<p>It’s comfortable to know your next steps on the career ladder. Getting from level N to N+1 is documented in the wiki, you make a plan with your manager from the blueprint and keep executing.</p>
<p>It’s comfortable to have the social capital to lean on. As an “old-timer” you get a different treatment and more opportunities.</p>
<h3>How not to quit Facebook</h3>
<p>This was not the first time I tried to quit Facebook.</p>
<p>In 2018 I found myself in between teams. My previous project was moved to Los Angeles, I moved to Seattle. At the time I was getting a steady email traffic from recruiters, so I decided to respond to some to see what the market has to offer.</p>
<p>I opened up Leetcode and started chipping away at the problems in the “Hard” section. It took me days to solve some and I felt miserable.</p>
<p>Self-doubt crept in, and I started to lose motivation. I hopped on 2 phone screens and failed both. It was humiliating and I felt like shit.</p>
<p>In the end things turned out to be pretty good for me. I doubled down on internal search and found a manager with an ambitious dream, and together we built Messenger Desktop.</p>
<p>For a while, Messenger Desktop did feel like a startup. We built MVPs, did user research, pivoted, built even better product. We grew a team from zero to 18 people, then doubled. It was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>But after a while, big corporation found its way in. Reorgs. Leadership changes. Direction churn. Politics. Lots of talks and meetings, and very little progress forward. The key people got burnt out and started leaving.</p>
<p>It was time for me to go, too. But this time I was determined to do it better.</p>
<h3>Looking for a new company</h3>
<p>As a blueprint for my latest job search I took a course made by my friend: <a href="https://jobsearch.dev/">Senior Engineer Jobsearch</a>.</p>
<p>The most important thing I did this time was to change my mindset. Instead of trying to escape my unhappiness at Facebook, I took this as an opportunity to learn more about companies.</p>
<p>I started with The Narrative: a 2 page document outlining my career story so far, highlighting things that worked and things that didn’t, environments and products where I was the happiest, things I wanted to learn and risks I was willing to take.</p>
<p>At the time it felt like I was spending too much time on it (~ a week). In retrospect I wish I spent more time on it, and I’ll explain why in a second. Also it was a good idea to share this document with a few managers I’ve worked in the past, they helped me add and refine a bunch of points in the narrative.</p>
<p>I’ve set a deadline for myself to make a decision ~ 2 months out. This helped a lot because I could plan my interviews to all happen towards that date. In retrospect, it took 3 months to explore, interview, negotiate and make a decision.</p>
<p>3 months might seem like a lot, but only if you think of it as a chore or something you have to go through. With the right mindset, it’s one of the most fun and exciting times of my career. I’ve met a bunch of awesome people and learned a ton about the market and myself.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>Most recruiters are terrible. They send generic job descriptions if there’s a matching word in your resume. I’m very surprised the market didn’t push the recruiter game up. There’s so much room for improvement!</p>
<p>Avenues I’ve used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replied to a few dozens LinkedIn message requests. These resulted in a few phone calls, but none of them seemed to be the right fit</li>
<li>Replied to a dozen emails sent directly to my email address. Some of these resulted in interview loops.</li>
<li>Directly reached out to a few companies I’ve heard of.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time in the spirit of exploration I also talked to a few fintech companies. I entered the discussions with pre-existing biases that these places are stressfull, not innovative but well paying. The conversations confirmed these biases (except the salaries, which were lower than I expected).</p>
<p>In the end I applied to a bunch of smaller tech-related companies.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>My preparation plan was different this time, too. Instead of jumping on “Hard” leetcode questions, I started with “Easy”. It was reassuring, I could churn out a bunch of these in an hour, and it was so satisfying to see green check marks next to the unit test runs.</p>
<p>I asked a few friends for mock interviews. These were useful too.</p>
<p>But the highest return on time invested was not related to doing things at the computer. I’ve fixed my sleep schedule, made sure to walk a lot every day and eat better food.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this plan was simple: I’ve been coding for almost 20 years. In my experience, the right mindset and good physical shape are far, far more important for problem solving than practicing very niche coding tasks.</p>
<h3>Interviews</h3>
<p>This time I had zero interviews asking me to do leetcode-like problems. By leetcode I mean an abstract graph problem that has a traditional memory/CPU trade-offs.</p>
<p>All problems felt very relevant. E.g. at Replit the phone screen task was to build a small part of Replit, Figma asked to align 2 rectangles and design Figma file format, etc.</p>
<p>What I loved about these problems is that they were all very relevant to the product. They are also very “real-world”, with no best solution, and readability was important too.</p>
<h3>Offers and compensation</h3>
<p>Facebook aims to pay top 5% of the market. Which means almost everywhere you go, the pay would be lower.</p>
<p>Comparing FAANG and startup offers is hard. Facebook stock is basically cash. Startup equity throws you into long articles about ISOs and tax complications. I’ve spent tens of hours trying to figure out how to reason about these and still didn’t have a satisfying answer.</p>
<p>To cut the chase, the best offer I got was roughly 70% of what I was making at Facebook.</p>
<p>However, I found the process of comparing raw numbers like that very damaging. It spawns a rational though: if I were leaving Facebook to find a more fulfilling role, maybe I should stay, take the 30% difference and invest in a personal trainer or a couch? Plus an extra exotic vacation to boost that happiness levels.</p>
<p>The way out of this is to consider the total compensation as a lagging factor. You can optimize it within a certain range, but it’s much better idea to invest into the leading factors instead.</p>
<p>You should also read this article on <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">salary negotiation</a>. Senior Engineer Jobsearch goes over this too: when speaking to the recruiters you are at disadvantage and you should at the very least be aware of basic tactics.</p>
<p>In my experience, having competing offers made it possible to get better numbers. But numbers is not the only thing.</p>
<h3>Making a decision</h3>
<p>Ultimately making a choice is hard and very personal.</p>
<p>You also have to keep track of the incentives here. Recruiters’ and hiring managers’ job is to close you. That’s where the narrative document from earlier is extremely helpful. In the whirlpool of calls and discussions you have to keep your narrative front and center, otherwise you’ll get pulled into comparing meaningless benefits you don’t really care about.</p>
<h3>Accepting offer, giving notice, etc.</h3>
<p>For some reason I thought of these events as big milestones. In the end accepting the offer was as easy as clicking a Docusign form. Leaving Facebook wasn’t much more complicated: I emailed my HRBP, we’ve scheduled an exit interview. I got a checklist of items to do (transferring my phone number was the hardest one).</p>
<p>The exit interview was pleasant. Just a couple of basic questions (I’ve heard they replaced it by a form now).</p>
<p>The next Monday I started at the new place.</p>
<h3>After 9 months</h3>
<p>I still have good friends working for Facebook, and when we chat about work, I can’t help but notice how unimportant the old problems seem to me. A new reorg? That person being a dick? In the past I was upset by choosing bad trade-offs, teams acting in selfish fashion, drama and re-orgs. Now these problems seem so distant.</p>
<p>First week at the new place was like drinking from the fire hose. Slack messages, email, tools, terminology I did not understand. Under the hood it’s still code, and I was able to ship a few small fixes by the end of the first week.</p>
<p>I do miss a bunch of Facebook internal tools. Phabricator, Workplace, Scuba, Deltoid and a bunch of others.</p>
<p>During the first month I had to unlearn a bunch of Facebook skills. E.g. a common thought that crept into my decision process there was “Is this big enough scope? Can I communicate the importance of this and get people involved recognized?”</p>
<p>After joining Replit 9 months ago, I’ve shipped <a href="https://blog.replit.com/multiplayer-debugging">debugger</a>, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/rui-eng">the new design system</a>, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/solidity">web3 support</a>. The team is top notch, and the vibes remind me my early days at Facebook so much.</p>
<p>A common question I get is about work/life balance. And I view it a little different too now. At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day. But the job was so unsatisfying that it spilled the frustration in the “life” part. So I re-frame the question: how’s work affecting your life? For me leaving Facebook was definitely a huge improvement.</p>
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>I’m now working on making <a href="https://blog.replit.com/mobile-v2">mobile</a> experience for Replit users much nicer. So many people outside of US are learning to code on their phones, and this space gets no attention from the professional programmers. I have a million ideas that have been brewing in my head for the last 5 years and I can’t wait to put them to use.</p>
<h3>One more thing…</h3>
<p>Re-reading this post might seem like I know what I’m doing. I don’t. It’s easy to connect the dots looking backward and assemble a story. But living through that story is a different experience.</p>
<p>If any part of this story was interesting to you, please feel free to reach out. I have my email address published on this website and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_frantic">Twitter</a> DMs are good, too.</p>

        <p>React is ~8 years old. I remember the day when I saw the first demo — I was amazed at how genius yet how simple it was! I still carry that excitement to this day.</p>
<p>During this time React changed a bunch, but its core ideas have stayed the same. It’s still all about thinking about your UI code as a function of state, bringing state front and center, immutable data, one-directional data flows, composition over inheritance.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll share how the developer APIs have evolved, specifically we’ll talk about defining components and sharing common code between components.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Initeresting things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>/** @jsx React.DOM */</code> was required for the JSXTransformer to convert XML-in-JS syntax (like <code>&lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;</code>) to function calls (like <code>React.DOM.div({}, 'Hello')</code>)</li>
<li><code>React.createClass</code> was used to create a component. I think in hindsight naming it <code>Class</code> and not <code>Component</code> was a big marketing mistake: with ES6 classes many people were pushing for React to adopt the “standard” way, although it had a lot of problems (more on that later).</li>
<li>In development, React performed <code>props</code> validation at runtime (Flow and TypeScript didn’t exist back then), and the <code>PropTypes</code> API allowed for pretty complex definitions with nested objects and arrays.</li>
<li>Initially, without <code>React.autoBind</code> the methods on the components had dynamically scoped <code>this</code>, which was pretty confusing: calling <code>this.tick</code> would result in something like “Can’t call <code>setState</code> of unndefined”. <code>autoBind</code> was doing something like <code>fn.bind(this)</code> to fix it on per-function basis, and eventually this behavior was moved directly into <code>React.createClass</code>.</li>
<li>React focused on a pure, functional, declarative approach to bulding UIs, but also had escape hatches that allowed programmers take imperative actions or talk to DOM when needed via lifecycle methods and refs.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you look carefully at the example above, you’ll notice that there’s a memory leak! We <code>setInterval</code> without <code>clearInterval</code>-ing it. To fix the problem we’d have to call <code>clearInterval</code> from <code>componentWillUnmount</code>, however that wasn’t obvious from the APIs and programmers had to watch out for patterns like this.</p>
<p>That was a common pitfall: managing resources and making sure parts that were not managed by React were in sync with the UI.</p>
<p>It was clear there’s a need for a way for the components to share behavior traits. Early versions of React shipped with a solution to this problem: mixins.</p>

<p>The code above fixes the memory leak and makes it easier to avoid this problem in the future: just include <code>SetIntervalMixin</code> and you are good to go!</p>
<p>Mixins fixed some problems, but intruduced others: implicit dependencies, name clashes and snowballing complexities. <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html">Read more on the official blog post (2016)</a>.</p>
<h2>2015, <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html">React v0.13</a>: <code>class extends React.Component</code></h2>
<p>The big feature of this release was ES6 class support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript originally didn’t have a built-in class system. Every popular framework built their own, and so did we. This means that you have a learn slightly different semantics for each framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We figured that we’re not in the business of designing a class system. We just want to use whatever is the idiomatic JavaScript way of creating classes.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>However, in my opinion ES6 classes didn’t fix the problem, but made it worse.</p>
<p>First, the benefits weren’t super valuable. React shipped <code>Component</code> and <code>PureComponent</code> to inherit from, inheriting other components was discouraged (in favor of <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html">composition</a>).</p>
<p>Second, the semantics resulted in a bunch of ergonomics problems.</p>
<p>In the example above, if you forgot to do <code>this.tick.bind(this)</code>, you’ll get the same “Can’t call <code>setState</code> of unndefined” as in pre-<code>autoBind</code> days. There were several popular ways to address this, none of them seemed ideal though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do it inline: easy to forget, <code>bind</code> returns a new function instance for every call (which hurts if you rely on <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-js">&lt;button onClick={<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">increment</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>)} /&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Do it in the constructor: verbose, easy to miss:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>

<ul>
<li>Arrow functions + E7 property initializers: its syntax is inconsistent with method definitions in subtle ways (also note <code>;</code> at the end of <code>tick</code>):</li>

<h3>Higher-order components</h3>
<p>As mixing were goin away, the developers needed to fill the gap: find a way to reuse common functionality across components.</p>
<p>HoC became a popular replacement for mixins. You can think of the pattern as writing a function that takes a component as its argument, and returns a new component that wraps it with some useful enhancement.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of HoC that does the same thing as the <code>SetIntervalMixin</code> from the earlier example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">withTimer</span>(<span class="hljs-params">Component</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span>.<span class="hljs-property">Component</span> {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">super</span>(props);
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">intervals</span> = [];
    }
    <span class="hljs-built_in">setInterval</span> = <span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">callback, interval</span>) =&gt;</span> {
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">intervals</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">push</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">setInterval</span>(callback, interval));
    };
    <span class="hljs-title function_">componentWillUnmount</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">intervals</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">clearInterval</span>);
    }
    <span class="hljs-title function_">render</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
      <span class="hljs-comment">// Render the original component with some additional props</span>
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Component</span> {<span class="hljs-attr">...this.props</span>} <span class="hljs-attr">setInterval</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{this.setInterval}</span> /&gt;</span></span>
    }
  }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Timer</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">React.Component</span> {
  <span class="hljs-title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {

  }
  <span class="hljs-title function_">componentDidMount</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
    );
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>HoC promise is to use functional composition to solve the trait problem. But they do come with their own drawbacks too, especially around the ergonomics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating and using them is verbose, it’s not uncommon to end up with wrappers on top of wrappers, e.g. <code>withTranslations(withTimer(connect()(Timer)))</code>.</li>
<li>This indirection breaks <code>refs</code> and makes writing pure components harder, unless implemented carefully.</li>
<li>Devtools show very deep wrapped component hierarchies that hurt readability:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/react-api-evolution/deep-hocs.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Render props</h3>
<p>React community kept looking for better ways to reuse logic in components and for some time a pattern called “render props” gained a bunch of popularity. I’m not going to dive into these dark ages, but the idea was similar to HoC.</p>
<h2>2019, <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html">React v16.8</a>: Hooks</h2>
<p>Around the time the release with ES6 was published, the React team made it possible to define components as simple functions, aka “stateless functional components”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Timer</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>Hello, {props.name}!<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>;
}

<span class="hljs-title class_">React</span>DOM.<span class="hljs-title function_">render</span>(<span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Timer</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Alex&quot;</span> /&gt;</span></span>, <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;main&quot;</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>This was very popular: simple, concise, idiomatic. However, how do you get access to state or lifecycle methods?</p>
<p>After a bunch of prototyping and explorations, the React team presented the way – hooks.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Timer</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [seconds, setSeconds] = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);

  <span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> interval = <span class="hljs-built_in">setInterval</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">setSeconds</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">s</span>) =&gt;</span> s + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>), <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
      <span class="hljs-built_in">clearInterval</span>(interval);
    };
  }, []);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
      Hello, {props.name}! It&#x27;s been {seconds} seconds
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Programmers familiar with algebraic effects saw the striking similarities.</p>
<p>Notably, the mental model of hooks shifted from “lifecycle methods” to “sync things outside React’s control with UI”.</p>
<p>For example, <code>useEffect</code> is built in a way that makes it easy to colocate resource acquisition and release, making memory leaks much easier to avoid. The second argument to <code>useEffect</code> is a list of dependencies, if any of them change between calls to the same <code>useEffect</code>, React will clean up the previous one and will recreate a new one. Getting this right with <code>componentDidMount</code> / <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> / <code>componentWillUnmount</code> was hard.</p>
<p>Hooks have solved the problem of sharing common functionality across components in a very elegant, composable ways:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">useInterval</span>(<span class="hljs-params">callback, ms</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> interval = <span class="hljs-built_in">setInterval</span>(callback, ms);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
      <span class="hljs-built_in">clearInterval</span>(interval);
    };
  }, [callback, ms]);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Timer</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [seconds, setSeconds] = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
  <span class="hljs-title function_">useInterval</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">setSeconds</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">s</span>) =&gt;</span> s + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>), <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>);

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
      Hello, {props.name}! It&#x27;s been {seconds} seconds
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>But hooks were not without problems either: in the example above there’s a subtle problem with the callback we pass to <code>useInterval</code>: since it’s a new referance every time (in JS, <code>() =&gt; {}</code> !== <code>() =&gt; {}</code>) we end up re-creating interval every render. The solution looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Timer</span>(<span class="hljs-params">props</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [seconds, setSeconds] = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> increment = <span class="hljs-title function_">useCallback</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">setSeconds</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">s</span>) =&gt;</span> s + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>), []);
  <span class="hljs-title function_">useInterval</span>(increment, <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>);

  <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compared to <code>React.Component</code> and mixins, React Hooks traded <code>this</code> and related class gotchas for JS scope gotchas. I think it was a good trade to make.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<ol>
<li>React did an awesome job keeping the API surface very small. Watching the documentation across all these years felt like the team is actively <em>removing</em> things that are non-essential.</li>
<li>React evolved in a steady, backwards-compatible way. You can still use <code>React.createClass</code> APIs via a package, if you want to. Facebook code written in 2013 still works fine (after applying minor codemods).</li>
<li>React is at odds with JavaScript: from JSX syntax, ES6 class method bindings gotchas to reinvention of algebraic effects.</li>
</ol>

      <title>A side project story: octave.im (2013-2016)</title>
      <updated>2021-02-23T12:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <link rel="alternate" href="https://frantic.im/octave" />
      <summary>A story about my attempt at SaaS</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>It all started around 2013: I was going through a course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning by Andrew Ng</a>.</p>
<p>The practical part of the course depended on GNU Octave (open source math toolkit), but installing it on a Mac was a huge pain. I did manage to do it, but noticed that many people on forums complanied about the same thing.</p>
<p>So I had a brilliant idea — wouldn’t it be great if Octave was available via SaaS model? With fancy features like built in code editor, command line and plots?</p>
<h1>Node, React &amp; Docker</h1>
<p>I built the first prototype in one night on June 8, 2013. I used NodeJS 0.10-ish with socket.io on the server side and CodeMirror with some plugins on the frontend.</p>
<p>In October that year I rewrote the frontend in React — the experience of doing so was amazing! React was young (<code>createClass</code>/<code>autobind</code>/<code>mixins</code>) but its programming model “clicked” with me. I remember hanging out in their IRC channel looking for help with autoscrolling. I was really impressed at how quick and friendly the response was (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/sophiebits">@sophiebits</a>!).</p>
<p>The initial version of the backend would just run <code>octave</code> in a dedicated folder. My second iteration ued Docker, which at the time was very new and unproven. It all ran on a Digital Ocean 2GB RAM droplet.</p>
<p>The killer feature was displaying plots inline in a REPL. You can see it on this gif:</p>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/octave.im/octave-demo.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>It worked through a clever hack: I pre-configured Octave to use gnuplot with special arguments that made it save the graph to a file (instead of showing it on the screen). My NodeJS backend listened to filesystem changes and notified the frontend when it detected the update.</p>
<h1>Product market fit</h1>
<p>I tried to promote octave.im for the students of the ML course. I posted the link on forums couple of times and added it to the course wiki page (that was surprisingly very hidden). The reception among students has been really positive, but the course moderators weren’t happy: they wanted some kind of validation that it’s a serious thing (which it wasn’t).</p>
<p>Overall I had more than 3500 people sign up over the course of several years. Unfortunately I didn’t keep any metrics screenshots. The twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/OctaveCloud">@OctaveCloud</a>, got 57 followers (organically).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I used Mixpanel and loved its simple API and dashboards. They even sent me a free T-shirt :)</p>
<h1>Total profit: -$420</h1>
<p>As every other hacker out there I also hoped to make it sustainable, so in October 2015 I added $4 monthly subscription with 2 weeks trial. To be honest I wasn’t very serious about it at that point. I just wanted to play with Stripe, see if people would actually pay. And they did! Overall I have collected about $300 in revenue.</p>
<p>An interesting thing that I noticed was that people subscribe and then stop using the product, without unsubscribing (I did have the unsubscribe button on the profile, no questions asked). I ended up manually cancelling a bunch of subscriptions on Stripe without updating the app DB, so people could still use the service (which they didn’t anyways).</p>
<h1>In numbers</h1>
<ul>
<li>308 commits</li>
<li>3,500 accounts created</li>
<li>450,000 commands executed</li>
<li>$300 total revenue</li>
<li>$720 spent on hosting</li>
</ul>

      <title>Moving my serverless project to Ruby on Rails</title>
      <updated>2020-11-14T12:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <link rel="alternate" href="https://frantic.im/back-to-rails" />
      <summary>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but the gravity sucked me in and I spend most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>I have a small side project: <a href="https://hacker.gifts">digital gift cards for hackers</a>. It uses Shopify for all the store-related stuff: frontend, payments, refunds, reports, etc.</p>
<p>But unlike regular digital products (ebooks, videos) I wanted each card that the user purchases from the store to be unique. So I made a  script that generates personalized images and ran it manually for every order.</p>
<p>The next logical step was automating this process. I started with serverless AWS Lambda. At the time it was the hot new tech and I wanted to learn more. It seemed very fitting for my use-case: single-responsibility functions that can run at any time and don’t require server maintenance.</p>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/simple-lambda.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It was super easy to get started. I built a JavaScript function and deployed it to AWS Lambda, added Shopify web hook and it all worked!</p>
<p>Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to get started</li>
<li>Don’t have to configure or maintain servers</li>
<li>Free for small loads</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work.</p>
<p>Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each <a href="https://hacker.gifts/products/space-invaders">puzzle</a>, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. What started as a simple function, grew into a bunch of serverless functions, SNS topics, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables. All bound together with plenty of YAML glue, schema-less JSON objects passed around and random hardcoded configs in AWS console.</p>
<p>I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries).</p>
<p>But this time it was different. I couldn’t refactor things as easily as I used to in traditional monolithic apps. Here’s why:</p>
<p class="large">When the building blocks are too simple, the complexity moves into the interaction between the blocks.</p>
<p>And the interactions between the serverless blocks happen <em>outside</em> my application. A lambda publishes a message to SNS, another one picks it up and writes something to DynamoDB, the third one takes that new record and sends an email…</p>
<p>I could test every single block in that flow, but I didn’t have confidence in the overall process. What if publishing fails, how would I know that? How would system recover? Can I rollback and try again? Where do the logs go?</p>
<p>Another swarm of problems was hiding in my configuration: bad Route 53 record, typos in SNS topics, wrong S3 bucket region. Tracing errors was a challenge, there’s no single log output I can look into.</p>
<p class="large">With serverless, I was no longer dealing with my project's domain, I was dealing with the distributed system's domain.</p>
<p>At this point I felt fooled.</p>
<p>I came for the easy way to deploy code and not think about servers, but in the end had to design my system around the platform’s limitations.</p>
<p>Drawbacks of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to follow information flow</li>
<li>Impossible to replicate production environment locally</li>
<li>Slow iteration speed</li>
<li>Lack of end-to-end testing</li>
<li>Immature documentation (dominated by often outdated Medium posts)</li>
<li>No conventions (have to make hundreds of unessential decisions)</li>
</ul>
<p>—</p>
<p>I was clearly not enjoying the serverless. So I decided to rewrite it. After all, it is a side project I’m doing for fun. The tech stack of choice — Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>I haven’t used Rails since 2013, and for the last 8 years at Facebook I’ve been mostly doing JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/logo.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The experience of picking Rails back up was really nice but… uneventful. Not much had really changed. A few things got added, a few small things moved around.</p>
<p>Of course I did <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38060">hit some magical Ruby issues</a>. But unlike my typical experience with JavaScript, I was quickly able to find the solution.</p>
<p>Rails comes with so many things built-in and configured. Over the years, without Rails, I used to gluing random JavaScript libraries together to roll my own routing, file storage wrappers, email preview pipeline, managing secrets, test setup with fixtures, database migrations, logging, performance reporting, deployment scripts. With Rails I didn’t have to think about all these details and could simply focus on making product-visible changes.</p>
<p>It was like driving a Tesla after years of making my own scrappy cars. Similar components, but all configured and aligned to work well together.</p>
<p>Benefits of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>
<ul>
<li>Conventions</li>
<li>Tooling, libraries</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Monolith is easy to understand and test</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>
<ul>
<li>Feels heavyweight in the beginning</li>
<li>Hurts if your opinions differ from Rails conventions</li>
<li>Have to host on a server</li>
<li>Doesn’t sound cool in 2020 (anymore and maybe yet)</li>
</ul>
<p>—</p>
<p>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</p>

      <title>TODO apps are meant for robots</title>
      <updated>2020-10-28T12:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <summary>What if I'm a left-handed person in the world of right-handed tools?</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>In my lifetime I’ve tried a dozen todo apps. In the beginning they all seem different, novel and special. Slick UI, shortcuts, tags, subtasks, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>But all our stories were the same: I start using the new app, then after awhile I stop using it.</p>
<p>Up until the last week I thought the problem was in myself (you probably think so too). After all, <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">David Allen</a> seems to have figured this shit out. Also there are people leaving long 5 star reviews on every major todo list app, they discuss them on forums, recommend them to friends.</p>
<p>But then I read <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Close_open_loops?stackedNotes=z5tiFxnNKMZCnc8G9R1N51L5hknyRGmyCQx18&amp;stackedNotes=z8aZybuJJopS5fL7TnPou2JcmCsBUJeqirbBh&amp;stackedNotes=z5vXaKVAPBNKAAi9RXNudduhyGadGXqtMVTEs">Andy Matuschak’s notes</a>, and it really resonated with me. What if I’m a left-handed person in the world of right-handed tools? All popular todo apps out there have the same problems:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Willpower needed to make decisions is a limited resource. And most TODO apps are lazy and don’t consider the impact on your willpower. You want to postpone a task? Please enter the exact date to postpone this to. Which project to add this to? Tags? Subtasks? The amount of things one can customize is really large, but making all this decisions has a cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long lists are overwhelming. TODO apps are all about lists. And these lists tend to get large when the tasks inflow exceeds the tasks outflow (i.e. every modern knowledge worker’s queue). Looking at the ever-growing list of things that need to get done is not inspiring to say the least. As the lists get longer, there’s less and less chance that anything from it will get done, which also decreases the motivation to look into these lists. Removing stuff without getting it done is also painful, it requires a complex emotional and rational decision to be made (see the point about the willpower above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of accomplishment is important but rare in the digital world. When you mark a task as done in your TODO app, it just hides it. That’s it, no reward, no sense of accomplishment (unless you make your own). I think that’s why some people like Trello or pen-and-paper TODO list: when you get something done, you can see a card moved or a text crossed out. An artifact that proves there was a task here, and now it’s done. Now you are one step closer to your goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to trust our systems. GTD works only when you follow the rules. If you let your inbox grow unbound, the whole point about GTD gets lost and you also start losing trust in GTD. Another negative feedback loop. I’ve never seen a TODO app that lets you recover from this downward spiral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasks are not the same. Get milk, write an essay, plan a vacation, reconnect with a friend. These are things of different magnitude, different emotional connection, different context and time commitment. Some tasks aren’t even tasks, e.g. simply items to keep track of or be reminded of. But TODO apps treat them the same. They get the similar looking rows neatly organized in a unified interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes humans need help. A little nudge here and there can make a huge difference. It’s also very personal: different things work for different types of people. I’ve made a list of strategies to help me get things done, and ended up with 13 items (things like “extract the next smallest step as a separate task” or “work on it for just 2 minutes”). Thirteen! Guess how many nudges all my TODO apps have? Zero (except the deadline push notification reminder which just adds anxiety).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context is important. We are tired in the evening and have less willpower. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmFwRkl-TTc">Getting a small task done first thing in the morning can boost our confidence and energy levels</a>. Work tasks are better be hidden during the weekend. Sophisticated TODO apps have the flexibility to do this, but they require a lot of investment in configuration</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I now see all TODO apps as a shallow copy-pasta of the same rigid, inhuman, anxiety-inducing template.</p>
<p>But there’s hope!</p>
<p>In fact the advanced solution technology lies in the hands of productivity enemies: social media apps and games. Instagram, TikTok and Candy Crush have figured all this out. They know how to make you do something with very little willpower. They know how to present information in a way that’s not overwhelming. They give you rewards for doing things. Hints, nudges, suggestions.</p>
<p>I think there’s plenty of room for TODO innovations.</p>
<p>As for me – I’m not registering a domain name for a new pet project. Not yet :)</p>

      <title>Optimize Your Meetings for Engagement</title>
      <updated>2020-09-24T12:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <link rel="alternate" href="https://frantic.im/remote-meetings" />
      <summary>Imagine you meet a bunch of old friends that you haven’t seen in a while. Everybody’s sharing their stories, and everybody else is actively listening, asking questions, and are fully immersed.</summary>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        
        
        
        <p>— So, does anybody have any feedback? Or questions?</p>
<p>Silence. 15 seconds feel like forever. I can’t tell by people’s expressions if they agree with what I have just presented. I know they must have things to say, why aren’t they speaking up?</p>
<p>This was so much easier with in-person meetings. Remote sucks!</p>
<h2>What if we just don’t know how to run remote meetings yet?</h2>
<p>After months of attending large VC-only meetings I think I found a pattern. I’ve also talked to a few people who also noticed the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Failure modes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The person leading the meeting is talking 90% of time, and because they don’t get much feedback they just continue to fill the silence with re-iterating their points.</li>
<li>Nobody else is speaking up.</li>
<li>Somebody’s speaking up but they focus on a minor detail and talk through it forever, nobody’s willing to stop them</li>
<li>In the end everyone is frustrated, the meeting feels like a waste of time and feels like it could have been replaced by a group post.</li>
</ul>
<p>But not all meetings where like that. A few were actually really good.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the secret sauce:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the current realities optimize your meetings for engagement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By engagement I mean this — imagine you meet a bunch of old friends that you haven’t seen in a while. Everybody’s sharing their stories, and everybody else is actively listening, asking questions, and are fully immersed.</p>
<p>Just imagine the things we could do if our remote meetings felt even remotely like that.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s a mindset shift. Switch your strategy from just doing the meetings the way you did before COVID (or the way everybody else is doing it right now) to optimizing for the engagement, and wonderful things will happen.</p>
<p>I think the solution has 3 key elements: organizational, human and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reserve 15 minutes in the beginning to warm up your group. Don’t do “let’s start with status update” — in my experience this tenses up the people involved and they mainly think about what they are going to say and are not listening / engaging. Instead, ask a question that encourages engagement (see next section).</li>
<li>If your goal is to generate ideas or collect meaningful feedback, split the large group into several smaller groups (see <a href="http://www.theworldcafe.com/key-concepts-resources/world-cafe-method/">World Cafe Method</a>). 4 or 5 people in the meeting seem to be the maximum we can handle to keep the engagement high.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Human:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ask and share personal bits of information, e.g. hobbies, silly facts, or opinions on things not related to work.</li>
<li>Overuse non-verbal expressions: gestures, smiles, nodding, etc. This will help everyone else understand your reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio is extremely important. Low latency is a must to avoid people talking over each other.  The quality is very important too, good software I’ve used before doesn’t broadcast your audio until it detects speech.</li>
<li>Provide tools that expand ways to communicate non-verbally: raising hand, reactions, polls, messages.</li>
</ul>
