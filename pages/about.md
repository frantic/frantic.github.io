My name is Alex Kotliarskyi.

Software Engineer and UX zealot.

I'm a cofounder and CTO of [Secta AI](https://secta.ai/). In the past, I worked at [Replit](https://replit.com/site/careers) on making programming more accessible. Before that I spent 8 years at Facebook building developer efficiency tools, React Native, Oculus mobile apps and Messenger.

I have a few too many keyboards.
