I have this unsettling urge to build things. Sometimes work just flows, [sometimes](/side-projects-are-hard) I question my life choices. Here are some of my side projects I built:

### [Unofficial Joking Hazard App](https://jokinghazard.app/) <span class="date">2020</span>

Inspired by the Cyanide & Hapiness Random Comic Generator, Joking Hazard is a game in which you compete with your friends and enemies to finish an awful three-panel comic, from a deck of cards with millions of possible combinations.

I built an app that lets you play this game on your phone.

### [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/) <span class="date">2018</span>

I believe tiny details can make a huge difference. I love building UIs, and over the years of doing so I noticed that not every engineer and designer can notice these details.

This game wouldn't be as good without help of my awesome friends. [Amanda](https://www.amandahum.com/) defined the visual look&feel of the game. [Keyan](https://keyanzhang.com/) helped with mobile support and thousand other details.

### [Hacker Gifts](https://hacker.gifts/) <span class="date">2018</span>

What gifts do you send to your geeky programmer friends?

I built an online puzzle hunt that starts with a postcard. The clue on the postcard leads to encrypted file, which leads to a server, and so on. WW91IGdldCB0aGUgaWRlYS4=. It's a pretty awesome experience.

### [Reflect](https://reflect.sh/) <span class="date">2017</span>

This tool helps make great live coding demos.

# Work Projects

### [Oculus App](https://oculus.com/app) <span class="date">2016-2017</span>

### [F8 App](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app) <span class="date">2015-2016</span>
