title: I'm a Tomorrowman
---

No, I shouldn't be writing this _now_. I'm tired, it's late, I have some other stuff that needs to be done. Words just don't flow, sentences seem incomplete and the overall structure could be better.

"You know what? – says my brain – Tomorrow is a much better time to finish this blog post. You'll be more inspired and refreshed. You'll have more time and will make this post perfect. Tomorrow it will be much easier to write."

But, of course, tomorrow never comes. After 24 hours it's still going to be _now_.
